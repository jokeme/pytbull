DESCRIPTION
-----------
pytbull is an Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS) Testing Framework
for  Snort  and  Suricata.  It  can  be used to test the detection and blocking
capabilities  of  an IDS/IPS,  to compare  IDS/IPS,  to  compare  configuration
modifications and to check/validate configurations.

MODULES
-------
The framework is shipped with about 300 tests grouped in 9 testing modules:

- clientSideAttacks
      This module uses a reverse shell to provide the server with instructions
      to download remote malicious files. This module tests the ability of the
      IDS/IPS to protect against client-side attacks.

- testRules
      Basic rules testing.  These attacks  are supposed  to be detected by the
      rules sets shipped with the IDS/IPS.

- badTraffic
      Non RFC compliant packets are sent to the server to test how packets are
      processed.

- fragmentedPackets
      Various fragmented  payloads  are sent to server  to test its ability to
      recompose them and detect the attacks.

- multipleFailedLogins
      Tests the ability of the server to track multiple failed logins (e.g.
      FTP). Makes use of custom rules on Snort and Suricata.

- evasionTechniques
      Various  evasion  techniques are used to check if the IDS/IPS can detect
      them.

- malwaresViruses
      As well as the  clientSideAttacks  module,  this module uses the reverse
      shell  to  download  malwares & viruses  from the server. This tests the
      ability of the server to detect viruses.

- shellCodes
      Send various shellcodes to the server on port 21/tcp to test the ability
      of the server to detect/reject shellcodes.

- denialOfService
      Tests the ability of the IDS/IPS to protect against DoS attempts.


It is easily configurable and could integrate new modules in the future.
